        <h4 style="background-color: chartreuse;"> STEALTH:</h4> The 25-tonne twin-engine aircraft, which will be bigger than other fighters in the Indian Air Force inventory, will have advanced stealth features to avoid detection by enemy radar. Dr Krishna Rajendra Neeli, project director of AMCA at ADA, said the aircraft would be on par or even superior to other fifth-generation stealth fighter aircraft in use globally.

     <h4> What is Stealth ?</h4>
     <p>
        
Stealth technology encompasses a range of design and operational strategies aimed at reducing the detectability of vehicles, aircraft, or equipment from enemy sensors. This includes minimizing radar cross-section through specialized shaping, materials, and coatings, as well as reducing infrared signatures and noise emissions. Stealth designs often feature low observable characteristics to mitigate reflection or scattering of radar waves, infrared radiation, and sound. Electronic countermeasures further enhance stealth capabilities by disrupting or jamming enemy detection systems.Stealth technology is also utilized in various military applications such as ships, submarines, ground vehicles, and consumer products like drones and personal equipment for special operations forces.
